Stacks are the infrastructure of the application i.e Api routes, Storage, Events etc. i.e DynamoDB and S3 buckets are gonna be the storage stack of the application.
SNS or Simple Notification Service would be the EventStack of the application.

You always deploy the app to keep it up to date when a stack is created//updated

API Gateway is simply the APIStack
